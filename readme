Student 1: What unauthorized sources of information did you use to
complete the assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information
that you used to complete the assignment, and describe how you used
them. The course "Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of
information, and any source that you have used but not listed in the
authorized sources should be included here. Please note that using an
unauthorized source may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the
nature of the interaction, may additionally require the interaction
being reported to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used
no unauthorized sources of information.

None.

Student 1: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

Not fun, but fairly helpful in learning about memory management.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Student 2: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

It was fairlt enjoyable, but a little tedious, especially in 
debugging.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

We did no create the most modular code (there are no functions 
for inserting or coalescing chunks), but we found this more spelled
out variation to be a lot easier to comprehend and code. If we had 
time, we would modularize, but alas we do not.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on
testheapmgr.c/heapmgr4.c/checker4.c/chunk4.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

 None.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on checker4.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

   checker4.c: line 112: low priority: 
   A function should consist of fewer than 140 lines;
   this function consists of 142 lines; consider refactoring

   checker4.c: line 112: low priority: 
   This function definition probably needs more local comments

   We feel checker4 is properly commented and the nature of the 
   function necessitates a long function (it's really only 2
   lines over the limit).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on heapmgr4.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

None.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on
testheapmgr.c/heapmgr5.c/checker5.c/chunk5.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

None.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on checker5.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

   checker5.c: line 46: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'bins' through an assert?

   (And other like it)

   The bins array does not require validation because it is 
   virtually stagnant.

    checker5.c: line 68: low priority: 
   This area is deeply nested at level 4, consider refactoring

   The logic of our understanding of the checker requires this
   level of nesting. It could be simplified, but it would require
   some fragmentation of logic that would make it less clear to 
   the reader.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on heapmgr5.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

None.

What are the CPU times and heap memory consumed by testheapmgr using
heapmgr1.c, heapmgr2.c, heapmgr3.c, heapmgr4.c, and heapmgr5.c, with
tests RandomRandom and Worst, with call count 100000, and with maximum
chunk sizes 2000 and 20000? COPY THE OUTPUT OF THE TESTHEAP SCRIPT HERE.
You will lose points if you provide the data in any format that differs
from the output of the testheap script.
